    <h1>Theranos</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
    <section>Theranos <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English">(/ˈθɛrənoʊs/)</a> was an American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_held_company"> privately held</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_technology">health technology</a> corporation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. It <br>

         was initially touted as a breakthrough technology company, with claims of having devised <br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"> blood tests </a> that required only very small amounts of blood and could be performed <br>
         very rapidly using small automated devices the company had developed. However, these claims <br>
          were later proven to be false. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-3"><sup>[3][4][5]</sup></a> Founded in 2003 by 19-year-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holmes">Elizabeth Holmes, <sup>[6]</sup></a> <br> Theranos raised more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar">US$7</a>00 million from venture capitalists and private investors, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-barrons-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
          <br> 
          resulting in a $10 billion valuation at its peak in 2013 and 2014. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-9"><sup>[8][9]</sup></a>
          <br><br>

        A turning point came in 2015 when medical research professors <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ioannidis">John Ioannidis</a> and <br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleftherios_Diamandis"> Eleftherios Diamandis</a>, along with investigative journalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carreyrou">John Carreyrou </a> of  <br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal">The Wall Street Journal,</a> questioned the validity of Theranos' technology. The company faced a string of <br> legal and commercial challenges from medical authorities, investors, the  <br> 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission"> U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission </a> (SEC),<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Medicare_and_Medicaid_Services">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a> (CMS), state <br> 
        attorneys general, former business partners, patients, and others. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> By June 2016, it was <br> estimated that Holmes' personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to virtually <br> nothing. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-Forbes_nothing-11">[11]</a> The company was near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy"> bankruptcy </a> until it received, in 2017, a $100 million loan <br> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortress_Investment_Group"> bankruptcy </a> secured by its patents. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-WSJ-20171224-12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>
        <br><br>
        
        In July 2016, Theranos received sanctions from the CMS, including the revocation of its <br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_Laboratory_Improvement_Amendments">CLIA</a> certificate and prohibition of Holmes and other company officials from owning or <br> operating a laboratory for two years. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-carreyrou-13"><sup>[13]</sup> </a> Theranos announced it would close its laboratory <br> operations and wellness centers to work on miniature medical testing machines. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-auto-14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> In April <br> 
        2017, Theranos said it had reached a settlement agreement with CMS. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> Following the CMS sanctions, the <br>
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walgreens">walgreens</a> pharmacy chain terminated its contract with Theranos and <br> filed a lawsuit claiming continuous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract">breaches of contract</a>. The suit was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settled_out_of_court">settled out of court</a>, <br> with Theranos compensating Walgreens for a much smaller amount than the claimed $140 <br> million, reported at about $30 million. After efforts to find a buyer went nowhere, what <br> remained of the company dissolved on September 4, 2018. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-TheranosShutdown-16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
         <br><br>
        
        On March 14, 2018, Theranos, Holmes, and former company president <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesh_Balwani"> Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani </a> were charged with "massive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud">fraud</a> " by <br> the SEC. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> One section of the complaint says Holmes falsely claimed in 2014 that the company had annual revenues of $100 million, a <br> thousand times more than the actual figure of $100,000. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> Theranos and Holmes agreed to resolve the charges against them, with <br> Holmes paying a fine of $500,000, returning the remaining 18.9 million shares that she held, relinquishing her control of the company, and <br> being barred from being an officer or director of any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company">public company</a> for ten years. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> According to the agreement, if Theranos were <br> acquired or otherwise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation">liquidated</a> , Holmes would not profit from her ownership until more than $750 million was returned to investors and <br> other preferred shareholders. Theranos and Holmes neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the SEC's complaint. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-barrons-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Balwani did not <br> settle. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> On June 15, 2018, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_for_the_Northern_District_of_California">U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California</a>  announced the indictment of Holmes on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_fraud">wire fraud</a> <br> and conspiracy charges. Balwani was also indicted on the same charges. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> The trial was scheduled to commence in August 2020, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> but <br> it has been delayed due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic </a> and Holmes' pregnancy. Holmes' trial is currently scheduled to begin on August 31, <br> 2021 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> , while Balwani's trial has been postponed until January 11, 2022. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> <br> <br>

    While at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University">Stanford University,</a> Elizabeth Holmes had an idea to develop a wearable patch that could adjust the dosage of drug delivery and <br> notify doctors of variables in patients' blood. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> She started developing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab-on-a-chip">lab-on-a-chip</a> technology for blood tests, with the idea to start a <br> company that would make blood tests cheaper, more convenient and accessible to consumers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-never-26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> Holmes dropped out of Stanford in <br> 2003 and used the education trust from her parents to found the company that would later be called Theranos, derived from a <br> combination of the words "therapy" and "diagnosis". <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-27"><sup>[27][28]</sup></a> The company's original name was "Real-Time Cures", <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-29"><sup>[8][29][30]</sup></a> which Holmes <br> changed after deciding that too many people were dubious about the word "cure". <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-parloff-8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
